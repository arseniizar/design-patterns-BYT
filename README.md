# C# Design Patterns Showcase

This repository contains a C# solution demonstrating three fundamental software design patterns. Each implementation is based on a defined business scenario and is verified by a corresponding set of NUnit tests.

## Implemented Patterns

- **Factory Method**: Decouples object creation by using a factory to instantiate different database connectors.
- **Adapter**: Integrates incompatible interfaces by adapting a legacy HR system's data format for a modern billing system.
- **Observer**: Creates a notification system where multiple observers react to state changes in a subject.
